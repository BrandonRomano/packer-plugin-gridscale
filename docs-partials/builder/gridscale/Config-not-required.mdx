- `api_url` (string) - The server URL to use to access your account. Default: "https://api.gridscale.io". Environment variable `GRIDSCALE_URL` can be set instead.

- `api_request_headers` (string) - APIRequestHeaders is for debug purpose only. Format: "key1:val1,key2:val2"

- `template_name` (string) - The name of the new template.

- `hostname` (string) - Name of the host.

- `server_name` (string) - Name of the server used for producing the template.

- `secondary_storage` (bool) - SecondaryStorage is set to true when the server needs a secondary storage
  during producing template process.
  **NOTE**: If `secondary_storage=true`, the template will be built from the second storage.

- `base_template_uuid` (string) - A pre-built template UUID. This template is used to produce another template. E.g: Ubuntu template.
  **NOTE**: One of these fields has to be set: `isoimage_uuid`, `isoimage_url`, `base_template_uuid`.

- `isoimage_uuid` (string) - A pre-built ISO image is used by the given ISO image UUID. If IsoImageUUID is set, IsoImageURL is ignored.
  **NOTE**: One of these fields has to be set: `isoimage_uuid`, `isoimage_url`, `base_template_uuid`.

- `isoimage_url` (string) - An URL is used to download the image. If IsoImageUUID is set, IsoImageURL is ignored.
  **NOTE**: One of these fields has to be set: `isoimage_uuid`, `isoimage_url`, `base_template_uuid`.

- `boot_command` ([]string) - This is an array of commands to type when the server instance is first
  booted. The goal of these commands should be to type just enough to
  initialize the operating system installer. Special keys can be typed as
  well, and are covered in the section below on the boot command. If this
  is not specified, it is assumed the installer will start itself.

- `boot_wait` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The time to wait after booting the initial virtual machine before typing
  the `boot_command`. The value of this should be a duration. Examples are
  `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause Packer to wait five seconds and one
  minute 30 seconds, respectively. If this isn't specified, the default is
  `10s` or 10 seconds. To set boot_wait to 0s, use a negative number, such
  as "-1s"

- `boot_key_interval` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - Time in ms to wait between each key press

- `files` ([]string) - A list of files' relative paths that need to be served on a HTTP server.
  Put this address ({{__HTTP__ADDRESS__}} is a placeholder, do not edit) http://{{__HTTP__ADDRESS__}}/path/to/file
  to `boot_command` to use http-served files in boot commands.
